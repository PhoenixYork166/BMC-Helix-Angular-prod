/**
 * Additional info
 * Please add => Focusin/focusout polyfill for Firefox based on this gist by @nuxodin. Addresses this bug in Firefox.
 * github: https://github.com/paulcpederson/focusin
 *
 * Install
 * npm install focusin
 *
 * Or, just copy focusin.min.js into your project if you don't use browserify.
 * The minified script automatically runs the polyfill method, so all you have to do is include it.
 *
 * Usage
 * focusin is a polyfill, so you don't need to assign it to a variable, just require it and call the polyfill method.
 * Obviously meant for browser environments and not Node.js.
 * If you only require the module no code will be attached to the window.
 * require('focusin').polyfill()

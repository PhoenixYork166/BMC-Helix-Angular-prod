# How to contribute to ADAPT

## Did you find a bug?


1. Be sure you're in the appropriate repo first. For general ADAPT issues relating to documentation, please submit your request in this repo. For ADAPT AngularJS components, please navigate to the [ADAPT-Angular repo here.](https://github.bmc.com/bmc-ux/adapt-angular) For the Icon Font, please navigate to [the Icon Font repo here.] (https://github.bmc.com/bmc-ux/dpl-iconfont)  

2. Ensure the bug or request was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues in the appropriate repo.

3. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the need, open a new one, referring to the **[Issue and Enhancement Template](https://github.bmc.com/bmc-ux/adapt-css/blob/master/issue_template_revised.md)** for the content to include in the issue or new feature/feature enhancement request. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

1. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

2. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

1. Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of ADAPT will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

1. Suggest your change in the [ADAPT Angular repo] (https://github.bmc.com/bmc-ux/adapt-angular) and start writing code.

** Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes. *

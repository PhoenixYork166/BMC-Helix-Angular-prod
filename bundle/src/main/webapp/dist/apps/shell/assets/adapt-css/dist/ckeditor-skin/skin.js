skin.js
=========
In this file we interact with the CKEditor JavaScript API to register the skin
and enable additional skin related features.
The level of complexity of this file depends on the features available in the
skin. There is only one mandatory line of code to be included here, which is
setting CKEDITOR.skin.name. All the rest is optional, but recommended to be
implemented as they make higher quality skins.
For this skin, the following tasks are achieved in this file:
	1. Register the skin.
	2. Register browser specific skin files.
	3. Define the "Chameleon" feature.
	4. Register the skin icons, to have them used on the development version of
		the skin.
*/

// 1. Register the skin
// ----------------------
// The CKEDITOR.skin.name property must be set to the skin name. This is a
// lower-cased name, which must match the skin folder name as well as the value
// used on config.skin to tell the editor to use the skin.
//
// This is the only mandatory property to be defined in this file.
CKEDITOR.skin.name = 'cke-adapt';
